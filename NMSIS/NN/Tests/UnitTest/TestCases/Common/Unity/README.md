We utilize the Unity Test Framework for testing the NMSIS/NN library.  

Additionally, we use `generate_test_runner.rb` to generate test runners. Running this script requires a Ruby environment—simply install the latest version available. For more details, please refer to the [Unity Helper Scripts Guide](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity/blob/master/docs/UnityHelperScriptsGuide.md).
