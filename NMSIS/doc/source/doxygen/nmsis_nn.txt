/** \mainpage Overview

This user manual describes the NMSIS NN software library, a collection of efficient neural network kernels
developed to maximize the performance and minimize the memory footprint of neural networks on Nuclei RISC-V processors.

The library is divided into a number of functions each covering a specific category:

 - \ref NNConv
 - \ref Acti
 - \ref FC
 - \ref SVDF
 - \ref Pooling
 - \ref Softmax
 - \ref groupElementwise
 - \ref LSTM

The library follows the [int8](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/quantization_spec) and int16  quantization specification of TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers.

If you want to learn more about it, please refer to [NMSIS-NN](../../../nn/index.html)
