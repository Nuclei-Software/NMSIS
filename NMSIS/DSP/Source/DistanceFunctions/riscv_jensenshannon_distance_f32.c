/**
 * @brief        Jensen-Shannon distance between two vectors
 *
 * This function is assuming that elements of second vector are > 0
 * and 0 only when the corresponding element of first vector is 0.
 * Otherwise the result of the computation does not make sense
 * and for speed reasons, the cases returning NaN or Infinity are not
 * managed.
 *
 * When the function is computing x log (x / y) with x == 0 and y == 0,
 * it will compute the right result (0) but a division by zero will occur
 * and should be ignored in client code.
 *
 * @param[in]    pA         First vector
 * @param[in]    pB         Second vector
 * @param[in]    blockSize  vector length
 * @return distance
