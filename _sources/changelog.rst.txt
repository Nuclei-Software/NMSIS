=========

V1.2.0
------

This is the version ``V1.2.0`` release.

.. note::

    - This 1.2.0 version will no longer support old gcc 10 verison, and it now only support Nuclei Toolchain 2023.10
      (gcc13 and clang17) or later. The major changes that can be felt are as follows:

    - The prefix of toolchain has changed from ``riscv-nuclei-elf-`` to ``riscv64-unknown-elf-``
    - The ``-march`` option has changed a lot, see https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-toolchain-conventions/pull/26, for examples:

      - ``b`` extension changed to ``_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs`` extension,
      - ``p`` extension changed to ``_xxldsp`` , ``_xxldspn1x`` , ``_xxldspn2x`` , ``_xxldspn3x`` extensions which means
        stardard DSP extension, Nuclei N1, N2, N3 DSP extensions
      - ``v`` extension changed to ``v``, ``_zve32f``, ``_zve64f`` extensions

      These extensions also can be combined in a certain order, please be cautious

    - The name of Libraries has changed with ``-march``, for examples, the library named ``libnmsis_dsp_rv32imacb.a`` is now named
      ``libnmsis_dsp_rv32imac_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs.a`` since ``b`` extension changed to ``_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs``

  - NMSIS v1.2.0 should be used with Nuclei SDK v0.5.0 or later
  - RVV intrinsic APIs is update to v0.12.0, please visit `rvv-intrinsic-doc <https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/releases/tag/v0.12.0>`_
