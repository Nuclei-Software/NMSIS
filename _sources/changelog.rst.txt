Changelog
=========

V1.0.3
------

This is the official release version ``V1.0.3`` release of Nuclei MCU Software Interface Standard(NMSIS).

This release is only supported by Nuclei GNU Toolchain 2021.12 and its later version,
since it required intrinsic header files in RISC-V GCC for B/P/V extensions.

The following changes has been made since ``V1.0.2``.

* **Documentation**

  - Update NMSIS Core/DSP/NN related documentation

* **Device Templates**

  - Add ``__BITMANIP_PRESENT`` and ``__VECTOR_PRESENT`` in ``<Device>.h``
  - Add more REG/ADDR/BIT access macros in ``<Device>.h``
  - Update linker script for ``<Device>.ld`` for Nuclei C Runtime Library
  - Add tp register initialization and add early exception setup during startup in ``startup_<Device>.S``
  - Adding support for Nuclei C Runtime library

* **NMSIS-Core**

  - Update ``core_feature_eclic.h``, ``core_feature_timer.h`` and ``core_feature_dsp.h``
  - Added ``core_feature_vector.h`` and ``core_feature_bitmainp.h``
  - Add more nuclei customized csr in ``riscv_encoding.h``

* **NMSIS-DSP/NN**

   - Add support for Nuclei GNU Toolchain 2021.12
   - Add new build system to generate NMSIS DSP and NN library
   - Update cmake files for both DSP and NN library
   - No need to define ``__RISCV_FEATURE_DSP`` and ``__RISCV_FEATURE_VECTOR`` when using DSP or NN library,
     it will be defined in ``riscv_math_types.h`` via the predefined macros in Nuclei RISC-V gcc 10.2
   - Rename ``RISCV_VECTOR`` to ``RISCV_MATH_VECTOR``
   - Fix FLEN and XLEN mis-usage in library

V1.0.2
------

This is the official release version ``V1.0.2`` release of Nuclei MCU Software Interface Standard(NMSIS).

  - SysTick_Reload function is introduced to reload system timer
  - Macro names started with SysTimer_xxx are changed, please check in the code.

- Removed unused lines of code in DSP and NN library source code which has unused macros which will not work for RISCV cores.

- Fix some documentation issues, mainly typos and invalid cross references.


V1.0.0-alpha
------------

This is the ``V1.0.0-alpha`` release of Nuclei MCU Software Interface Standard(NMSIS).

In this release, we have release three main compoments:

* **NMSIS-Core**: Standardized API for the Nuclei processor core and peripherals.

* **NMSIS-DSP**: DSP library collection optimized for the Nuclei Processors which has RISC-V SIMD instruction set.

* **NMSIS-NN**: Efficient neural network
  library developed to maximize the performance and minimize the memory footprint Nuclei Processors which has RISC-V SIMD instruction set.

We also released totally new `Nuclei-SDK`_ which is an SDK implementation based on the **NMSIS-Core** for Nuclei N/NX evaluation cores running on HummingBird Evaluation Kit.
