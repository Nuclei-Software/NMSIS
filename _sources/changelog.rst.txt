V1.0.0-alpha
------------

This is the ``V1.0.0-alpha`` release of Nuclei MCU Software Interface Standard(NMSIS).

In this release, we have release three main compoments:

* **NMSIS-Core**: Standardized API for the Nuclei processor core and peripherals.

* **NMSIS-DSP**: DSP library collection optimized for the Nuclei Processors which has RISC-V SIMD instruction set.

* **NMSIS-NN**: Efficient neural network
  library developed to maximize the performance and minimize the memory footprint Nuclei Processors which has RISC-V SIMD instruction set.

We also released totally new `Nuclei-SDK`_ which is an SDK implementation based on the **NMSIS-Core** for Nuclei N/NX evaluation cores running on HummingBird Evaluation Kit.
