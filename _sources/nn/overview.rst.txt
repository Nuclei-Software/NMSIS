Overview
========

Introduction
------------

This user manual describes the NMSIS NN software library,
a collection of efficient neural network kernels developed to maximize the
performance and minimize the memory footprint of neural networks on |nuclei_core| cores.

The library is divided into a number of functions each covering a specific category:

- Activation Functions
- BasicMath Functions
- Concatenation Functions
- Convolution Functions
- Fully-Connected Functions
- LSTM Functions
- NNSupport Functions
- Pooling Functions
- Reshape Functions
- Softmax Functions
- SVD Functions


The library has separate functions for operating on different weight and activation data
types including 8-bit integers (q7_t) and 16-bit integers (q15_t). The descrition of the
kernels are included in the function description.

The implementation details are also
described in this paper `CMSIS-NN: Efficient Neural Network Kernels for Arm Cortex-M CPUs`_ .

Examples
--------

The library ships with a number of examples which demonstrate how to use the library functions.

* :ref:`Gated Recurrent Unit Example<nmsis_nn_api_gated_recurrent_unit_example>`


Pre-processor Macros
--------------------

Each library project have different pre-processor macros controlled via CMakeLists.txt.

This library is only built for little endian targets.
